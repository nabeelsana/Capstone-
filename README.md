#Project Overview

This is the capstone project as part of Azure Nanodegree Program, Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure.

As required by the project we have selected "Heart failure clinical records" data set (details section below) and performed machine learning task of predicting survival of patients facing heart failure (binary classification ) using 12 feautures identified in the data set. 

As per the project guidance we created two experiments, one using Automated ML (AutoML) and another model using Scikit Learn Logistic Regression classifier, whose hyperparameters were tuned using HyperDrive

From each experiment we selected one best model based on "accuracy" metric. 

Details are: 

i) AutoML best model: 

ii) HyperDr

Based on comparison of two models we selected --- model from AutoML eperiment and then deployed it as a webservice (REST API). We then tested the webservice by sending a request to the model endpint.



#Dataset used

We have used Heart failure clinical records data set as published on "UCI Machine Learning Repository"and "Kaggle Heart Failure Prediction" competion. 

This data set has been published as part of folowing paper: Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman: "Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone". BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 20, 16 (2020).

This dataset contains the medical records of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan), during Aprilâ€“December 2015 [52, 66]. The patients consisted of 105 women and 194 men, and their ages range between 40 and 95 years old (Table 1). All 299 patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction and had previous heart failures that put them in classes III or IV of New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of the stages of heart failure.

The dataset contains 13 features, which report clinical, body, and lifestyle information, that we briefly describe here.

- Age: age of the patient (years)
- Anaemia: decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)
- High blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean)
- Ceatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
- Diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean)
- Ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
- Platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
- Sex: woman or man (binary)
- Serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
- Serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
- Smoking: if the patient smokes or not (boolean)
- Time: follow-up period (days)
- [target] Death event: if the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean)
